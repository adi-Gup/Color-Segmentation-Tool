# Color Segmentation Tool

This repository contains a Color Segmentation Tool created using KMeans designed to help isolate specific colors within images, making it ideal for image analysis, preprocessing, and feature extraction tasks in computer vision projects. The tool allows users to define color ranges and segment regions of interest efficiently. It supports both real-time segmentation (for video and webcam feeds) and static image analysis.

**Features**

1. Flexible Color Range Selection: Define custom color ranges using HSV, RGB, or other color spaces to precisely isolate colors.
2. Real-Time Processing: Segment colors in video streams for dynamic applications.
3. Image Input Support: Process static images for quick analysis and visualizations.
4. Adjustable Parameters: Easily tweak segmentation settings for better control and accuracy.
5. Visual Output: View segmented outputs instantly, highlighting areas that match your defined color criteria.
   
**Use Cases**
1. Object detection in specific color ranges
2. Image preprocessing for ML pipelines
3. Visual effects based on color segmentation
4. Simplified image masking for further analysis
